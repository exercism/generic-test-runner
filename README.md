# Exercism Test Runner Template

This repository is a [template repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) for creating automated test runners for [Exercism] tracks.

## Using the Test Runner Template

1. Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for creating a repository from a template repository
2. Name your new repository based on your language track (i.e. if your track is for Python, your test runner repo name is `python-test-runner`)
3. In your new repository:
    1. Remove the [Exercism Test Runner Template](#exercism-test-runner-template) section from README.md
    2. Modify Dockerfile and bin/run.sh to match your track's needs
4. The interface that test runners must conform to is defined in [this document](https://github.com/exercism/automated-tests/blob/master/docs/interface.md).

# Exercism TRACK_NAME_HERE Test Runner

The Docker image to automatically run tests on TRACK_NAME_HERE solutions submitted to [Exercism].

## Running the Tests
To run all of the tests, do the following:
1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `bin/run-all.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `results.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `test/<test-name>/results.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to generate and commit a new `test/<test-name>/results.json` file.

## Generating `results.json` for an Exercise
To run the tests of an arbitrary exercise, do the following:
1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <exercise-slug> <path/to/solution/dir/ </path/to/output/dir/>`

##  Generating `results.json` for an Exercise with Docker
*This script is provided for testing purposes.*

To run the tests of an arbitrary exercise using the Docker container, do the following:
1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <exercise-slug> <./relative/path/to/solution/dir/> <./relative/path/to/output/dir/>`

**Note**: the solution and output directory's **MUST** be relative paths!
