# Synopsis:
# Test the test runner by running it against a predefined set of solutions 
# with an expected output.

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected test results against the actual test results
# generated by the test runner.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests.sh

exit_code=0

# Iterate over all test directories

        # OPTIONAL: Normalize the results file
        # If the results.json file contains information that changes between 
        # different test runs (e.g. timing information), you should normalize
        # the results file to allow the diff comparison below to work as expected
